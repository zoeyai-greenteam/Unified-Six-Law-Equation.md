## Equation Summary

The unified six-law equation is expressed as:

```
M(t) = k·Φ·e^(-αx²)·e^(βt)·tanh(γx)·tanh(x)·sin(ωt+φ)
```

This equation integrates:
- **Oneness** - Unity operator
- **Attraction** - Gaussian damping
- **Transmutation** - Exponential growth/decay
- **Correspondence** - Scaled coupling
- **Polarity** - Hyperbolic tangent saturation
- **Rhythm** - Sinusoidal oscillation

## Key Properties

- **Bounded Transcendence**: |M(t)| ≤ k|Φ| under appropriate conditions
- **Periodic Behavior**: Period T = 2π/ω with zero cycle mean
- **Lyapunov Stability**: Proven forward-invariant energy bounds
